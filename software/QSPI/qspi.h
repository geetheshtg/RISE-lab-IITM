#define CR_TEIE           (1<<16)
//!FIFO threshold level. In indirect mode, this defines the threshold number of bytes in then fifo that will cause the fifo threshold flag(ftf, quadspi_sr[2]) to be set in indirect write mode(fmode=00).. in indirect read mode(fmode=01) if dmaen=1 then the dma controller for the corresponding channel must be disabled before changing the FTHRES value

//!Sample shift. By default, the QUADSPI samples data 1/2 of a CLK cycle after the data is driven by the Flash memory. This bit allows the data is to be sampled later in order to account for external signal delays. Firmware must assure that SSHIFT = 0 when in DDR mode (when DDRM = 1). This field can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
#define CR_SSHIFT         (1<<4 )
//!Timeout counter enable. This bit is valid only when memory-mapped mode (FMODE = 11) is selected. Activating this bit causes the chip select (nCS) to be released (and thus reduces consumption) if there has not been an access after a certain amount of time, where this time is defined by TIMEOUT[15:0] (QUADSPI_LPTR). Enable the timeout counter. By default, the QUADSPI never stops its prefetch operation, keeping the previous read operation active with nCS maintained low, even if no access to the Flash memory occurs for a long time. Since Flash memories tend to consume more when nCS is held low, the application might want to activate the timeout counter (TCEN = 1, QUADSPI_CR[3]) so that nCS is released after a period of TIMEOUT[15:0] (QUADSPI_LPTR) cycles have elapsed without an access since when the FIFO becomes full with prefetch data. This bit can be modified only when BUSY = 0.
#define CR_TCEN           (1<<3 )

//!Bit vectors for DCR 
//!Flash memory size. This field defines the size of external memory using the following formula. Number of bytes in Flash memory = 2[FSIZE+1] FSIZE+1 is effectively the number of address bits required to address the Flash memory. The Flash memory capacity can be up to 4GB (addressed using 32 bits) in indirect mode, but the addressable space in memory-mapped mode is limited to 256MB. If DFM = 1, FSIZE indicates the total capacity of the two Flash memories together. This field can be modified only when BUSY = 0.

#define SR_FLEVEL(x)      (x<<8)
//!Timeout flag. This bit is 1 when timeout occurs. It is cleared by writing 1 to CTOF
#define SR_TOF            (1<<4)
//!Status match flag. This bit is set in automatic polling mode when the unmasked received data matches the corresponding bits in the match register (QUADSPI_PSMAR). It is cleared by writing 1 to CSMF.
#define SR_SMF            (1<<3)
//!FIFO threshold flag. In indirect mode, this bit is set when the FIFO threshold has been reached, or if there is any data left in the FIFO after reads from the Flash memory are complete. It is cleared automatically as soon as threshold condition is no longer true. In automatic polling mode this bit is set every time the status register is read, and the bit is cleared when the data register is read.
#define SR_FTF            (1<<2)
//!Transfer complete flag. This bit is set in indirect mode when the programmed number of data has been transferred or in any mode when the transfer has been aborted. It is cleared by writing 1 to CTCF
#define SR_TCF            (1<<1)
//!Transfer error flag. This bit is set in indirect mode when an invalid address is being accessed in indirect mode. It is cleared by writing 1 to CTEF
